The demo was built and tested on one Windows 11 computer.

For simplicity there is no authentication and authorization build in.

Also, for simplicity, I did not create multiple projects. For instance, I could have created a separate project to deal with the domain (containing domain models, services and repositories) and another one to deal with the API models (request/response models, dtos)
